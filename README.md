You can 3D-print a multicopter using these OpenSCAD files. Just add motors, propellers, batteries, ESCs, reciever, and flight controller.

A 'star' arrangment of the arms is used for straightforward implementation and ease of modifying the total number of arms.

There are basically just 2 types parts to print: the arms and the hub.

To generate the STL file, open the .scad file in OpenSCAD and render by hitting the F6 key. Then export to STL by hitting the F7 key.
